# Car_Rental_System

The Car Rental System is a Java-based application designed to simulate a basic car rental management system. This system allows users to manage a fleet of cars, perform rental operations, and check the availability of cars in real-time. It serves as a fundamental learning project for Java programming and software development concepts.

## Features
### 1. Car Management
- Users can add new cars to the inventory with details such as brand, model, and rate.
- Each car is tracked for its availability status (available or rented).
### 2. Rental Operations
- Users can rent a car by selecting it from the available inventory.
- The system marks the car as rented upon successful rental.
### 3. Return Operations
- Users can return a previously rented car back to the inventory.
- The system updates the car's availability status upon return.
### 4. Availability Check
- Users can view a list of available cars that can be rented.
